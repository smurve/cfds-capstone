# Tactical Asset Allocation with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Capstone Project of AZEK's excellent CDFS class of 2019 with Andy Hoepner and Damian Borth

# Pre-requisites:
Warning: This is not a Deep Learning tutorial!

I assume you have some prior knowledge of Tensorflow or at least neural networks in general.

## Installation
I assume you have python3, pip and virtualenv installed or are able to handle your anaconda environment yourself. 
To get started, create a virtual environment

```virtualenv --python=python3 venv```

activate it

```. venv/bin/activate```

and install the requirements

```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

Then, you can start juypter-lab:

```jupyter lab``` 

When you want to run jupyter-lab such that you can connect to it remotely, activate the provided configuration file that tells jupyter to support that:

```mv jupyter_notebook_config.py.disabled jupyter_notebook_config.py```

and then 

```jupyter lab``` 

All Jupyter notebooks are pretty much self-explanatory. Give it a go!

## Happy Deep Reinforcement Learning!
