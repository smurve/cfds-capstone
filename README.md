Capstone Project of AZEK's excellent CDFS class of 2019 with Andy Hoepner and Damian Borth

# Pre-requisites:
Warning: This is not a Deep Learning tutorial!

I assume you have some prior knowledge of Tensorflow or at least neural networks in general.

## Installation
I assume you have python3, pip and virtualenv installed or are able to handle your anaconda environment yourself. 
To get started, create a virtual environment

```virtualenv --python=python3 venv```

activate it

```. venv/bin/activate```

and install the requirements

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
