I propose to create a little research project to answer the 


Deliverables: 
- Github code repository with well-documented python code in notebooks
- A synthetic market model based on simple assumptions: random walk assets with pre-determined trend patterns
- An LSTM-based neural-network, fed with time series data of a) original log returns and b) traditional signals
- A reinforcement learning setup that trains the network to maintain a portfolio
- A little paper that describes whether the algorithm was able to detect and exploit the (unknown) priors.
